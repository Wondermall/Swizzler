## Usage

Vanilla swizzling:

```objectivec
SEL setObjectSelector = @selector(setObject:atIndex:);
[NSArray wml_replaceInstanceMethod:setObjectSelector withBlock:^(NSArray *self, id object, NSInteger index){
	// your logic...
}];
```

Or if you want to call the original method from your new implementation:

```objectivec
__block IMP originalIMP = [NSArray wml_replaceInstanceMethod:setObjectSelector withBlock:^(NSArray *self, id object, NSInteger index){
	// hopefully this not what you're doing
	originalIMP(self, setObjectSelector, object, self.count - index - 1);
}];
```

Restore the original implementation, once you're done with swizzling:

```objectivec
[WMLSwizzler replaceClassMethod:setObjectSelector inClass:[NSArray class] withImplementation:originalIMP];
```


## Why

### TL;DR

If you're swizzling "the old" way, you might run into issues since you new selector `xyz_swizzledMethod` might be passed when you call the original implementation. Besides, the block-based API is nicer and more concise.

### Details

Swizzling is all fun and giggles until you screw it up. Please refer to these articles for more info:
